Mentoring Software Package
The basic requirements you must meet for the mentoring application are:

    Have classification to differentiate each person entered into the system as either a Mentee or a Mentor.
    Have a classification of Faculty and Students.
        A Mentee can be Faculty or a Student.
        A Mentor can be Faculty or a Student.
        You can both be a Mentee and a Mentor for different individuals.
    Determine what would be good fields to store, like name, phone number, email, etc. for the Mentee and Mentors. If using a database this will need to be shown in an Entity Relationship Diagram.
    The following functions will need to be created for your software:
        Have a way to match automatically on different criteria.
        Have a way to track how the Mentor - Mentee role is going.
        Ensure there is an application process so both Mentee and Mentor can apply.
        Ensure the ability to edit in a web page is enabled with the following tables:
            Persons - Either Mentee or Mentor
            Criteria for each person
            Tracking on how the relationship is going
